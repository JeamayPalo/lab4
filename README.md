Repetition Structures (For and While Loop)

#Problem 1: TuitionIncrease 
At one college, the tuition for a full-time student is $8,000 per semester. It has been announced that the tuition will increase by 3 percent each year for the next 5 years. Write a program with a loop that displays the projected semester tuition amount for the next 5 years. 

The program should print out the result in the form

In 1 year, the tuition will be $8002.3. In 2 years, the tuition will be $8103.2. In 3 years, ...
In 4 years, ... 
In 5 years, ... 

(If, for example, the tuition would cost 8002.3 dollars in one
year, etc.)

Problem 2: Factorial 

In mathematics, the notation n! represents the factorial of the nonnegative integer n. The factorial of n is the product of all the nonnegative integers from 1 to n. For example: 

7! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 = 5,040

Write a program that lets the user enter a nonnegative integer
and then uses a loop to calculate the factorial of that number.
Print the factorial to standard output.


Problem 3: TrianglePattern 

Write a program that creates a pattern like the one below. Let
the user input a nonnegative integer to determine the number of
lines of the pattern. Hint: Each iteration of the loop equals
one line.

For example, if the user enters 3, the pattern should look like
this:
